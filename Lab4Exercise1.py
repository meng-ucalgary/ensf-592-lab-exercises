# Exercise 1

# Solve each question below using comprehensions or generator expressions.

from itertools import count

# 1. Construct a list consisting of the double of n for each n up to 50 that is divisible by 5. Print the list.



# 2. Construct a generator expression for calculating all the powers of 8. Print the first 8 values of the expression.



# 3. Given the list of complex numbers below, construct a dictionary that holds the real component as the key and imaginary component as the value.
# Print the final dictionary.

values = [2 + 4j, 6 + 3j, -5 + 1j, 3 + 5j, 4 + 2j]


# 4. Construct a generator expression for calculating the first ten triangular numbers, starting with 0. Print the results.
# Hint: 0, 0 + 1 = 1, 0 + 1 + 2 = 3, 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, etc.



# 5. Given the list of coordinate tuples below, create a single set that lists each number that appears at least once.

coord = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (5, 2), (3, 6), (-1, 9), (7, 5), (4, 8), (6, 1), (0, 2)]
