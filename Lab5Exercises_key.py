    # Customize the setter for the rider's name so that only letters from A-Z/a-z are accepted.
    # Test result: A name such as Kesha should be valid, a name such as Ke$ha should throw an error.

    # Practice 2:
    # Use a regular expression to find all horse breeds that end with "an".
    # Test result: Morgan, Arabian, Friesian

    # Practice 3:
    # Construct a single set that lists all unique horse colours.
    # Test result: bay, grey, black, brown

    # Practice 4:
    # Create both a generator expression and its equivalent generator function that can be used to calculate how old each rider will be in 2031.
    # Create tuples to pair each rider with their future age. Print out the results.
    # Test result: (Alex, 44) (Jordan, 55) (Ali, 38) (Page, 30) (Jay, 24)

    # Practice 5:
    # Create a dictionary where the rider's name is the key and their assigned horse is the value. Use the dictionary to find and print the name of Ali's horse.
    # Test result: Thunder
